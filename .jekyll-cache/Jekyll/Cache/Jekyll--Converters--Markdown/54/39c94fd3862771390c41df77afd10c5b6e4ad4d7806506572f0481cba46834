<p>Once you’ve done that, see what files are available to you and see what you can find in the file(s).</p>

Kind of similar to FTP, SSH to a server with:
<code>ssh x.x.x.x -l username</code><br />
or<br />
<code>ssh username@x.x.x.x</code><br />
... where x.x.x.x is the IP address of the SSH server.<br />
<br />
<blockquote>The first time you SSH to something, you'll get a warning about the authenticity of the host and fingerprint, and blah, blah, blah. Just type yes at the warning message. What could possibly go wrong with that?</blockquote><br />
Enter the password when prompted.<br />
<br />
To list files, use <code>ls</code>.<br /><br />
To output the contents a file to your screen, type:<br />
<code>cat filename</code><br /><br />
To disconnect from this session, type <code>exit</code>.<br />

Use:<br />
<code>ls -a</code><br />
... to show <b>all</b> directories and files in your current directory, even if they're "hidden".<br />
<br />
You can tell if they are hidden because they have a . in front of the directory or file name. It's like a really little kid playing hide and seek ... "If I put a dot in front of my name, you can't see me, right?!"

After reading crashoverride's message, take a look at the <code>find</code> help.
<br />
Disclaimer - I personally find the CLI help for <code>find</code> to be ... not so helpful. If you don't find the help you need in <code>find</code>'s help, maybe you'll find that the help you find online will help you use <code>find</code> in a way that helps. Something like that.<br />
<br />
Suggested search: <b>linux find examples</b><br />
<br />
You can also check the manual for <code>find</code> - it's really long, but much more clear to me than the <code>--help</code> information. While we're at it - I might as well mention that you can also find the manual for most commands online really easily too! I like doing that because you can easily use CTRL+f to search on the page for a specific word if you'd like. How do you find the manuals? I typically just use the same words I'd use at the CLI! In this case, just do a search for "man find". This one in particular may come up with unrelated results, but you should also find the manual info too!

Use:<br />
<code>find . -name thep*</code><br />
Let's break that down:
<ul>
<li><code>.</code> - the humble period is Linux's shorthand for "this directory". This tells find to look here. Find works recursively by default, so you don't have to tell it to do that like you would with <code>ls</code></li>
<li><code>-name</code> - this tells find that the attribute of the file we're searching by is the name. Of course it's the file name! What else would you search by?! You may be sorry you asked in a bit :)</li>
<li><code>thep*</code> - "thep" is the only piece of the filename that user crashoverride gave us. You have to put the wildcard * after that since you don't know if or how many characters follow that part of the file name.</li>

You're looking for a book of course, not a movie! <br />
OSINT sometimes depends on you using just the right search terms, but hopefully this one shouldn't be too tricky with the info given by gollum. Give multiple search engines a try, never know what might pull up that specific bit of info you're looking for.

Using the search term: "first story with Bilbo and Gollum" in a Google search gets you a lot of answers related to the 1937 book, "The Hobbit".
Using that search term in Bing (as of September 2022 anyway) gets you a nice clear-cut answer:
<image src="/images/hobbit.png"></image>
<br />
So now you just have to find the file made in 1937! Wow, this computer must be old, huh?
For that, we revisit our old friend <code>ls</code>. The <code>-l</code> option outputs the directory's contents in what they call "list" format, which includes some more info besides just the file names, for example, the last time the file was modified!
