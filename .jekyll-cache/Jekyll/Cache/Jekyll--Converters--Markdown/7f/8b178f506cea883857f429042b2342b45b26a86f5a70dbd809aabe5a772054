After reading crashoverride's message, take a look at the <code>find</code> help.

Disclaimer - I personally find the CLI help for <code>find</code> to be ... not so helpful. If you don't find the help you need in <code>find</code>'s help, maybe you'll find that the help you find online will help you use <code>find</code> in a way that helps. Something like that.<br />
<br />
Suggested search: <b>linux find examples</b><br />
<br />
You can also check the manual for <code>find</code> - it's really long, but much more clear to me than the <code>--help</code> information. While we're at it - I might as well mention that you can also find the manual for most commands online really easily too! I like doing that because you can easily use CTRL+f to search on the page for a specific word if you'd like. How do you find the manuals? I typically just use the same words I'd use at the CLI! In this case, just do a search for "man find". This one in particular may come up with unrelated results, but you should also find the manual info too!

Using the search term: "first story with Bilbo and Gollum" in a Google search gets you a lot of answers related to the 1937 book, "The Hobbit".
Using that search term in Bing (as of September 2022 anyway) gets you a nice clear-cut answer:
<image src="/images/hobbit.png"></image><br />
<br />
So now you just have to find the file made in 1937! Wow, this computer must be old, huh?
For that, we revisit our old friend <code>ls</code>. The <code>-l</code> option outputs the directory's contents in what they call "list" format, which includes some more info besides just the file names, for example, the last time the file was modified!<br />
<br />
<pre>
gollum@thehaxthatrocksthecradle:~/.treasures$ ls -l

-rw-rw-r-- 1 gollum gollum 23 Jul 29  1937 a1d0c6e83f027327d8461063f4ac58a6

<details>
<summary>Level 16 - Full Answer</summary>

<br />
<span style="color:MediumSeaGreen">
Running the <code>uniq</code> command with no options isn't quite enough.<br />
By default, it will just de-duplicate the lines in the file. That still leaves us with a lot (12,595) lines, and doesn't tell us which one was unique to begin with!<br />
<br />
Using the <code>-u</code> option shows us <bold>only</bold> the unique line, and ignores the rest:
<pre>
bilbo@thehaxthatrocksthecradle:~$ uniq -u creds 
99b2a15856249b868abbfc92dea6cee6
</pre>
<br />
Note that this won't work in a file with randomized lines, you'd have to sort the lines first. <code>uniq</code> compares one line with the lines around it. In this case, the duplicates are all one after the other, so <code>uniq</code> works by itself.<br />
