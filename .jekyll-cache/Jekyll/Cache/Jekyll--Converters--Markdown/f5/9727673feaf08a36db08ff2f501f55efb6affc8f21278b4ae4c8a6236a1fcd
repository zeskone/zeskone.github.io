Check out usage information for <code>netcat</code>. This is another utility where, honestly, the <code>--help</code> leaves me ... not helped. Maybe check the <code>man</code> for it or find some help online.

It may be worth pointing out that people very often us <code>nc</code> as the command for <code>netcat</code>. So often in fact, that I <i>just</i> found out right now that you can use the full word <code>netcat</code> - at least in current versions of Kali and Ubuntu. Who knew? (not me, apparently).<br />
<br />
Once you know the command to use, the syntax for <code>nc</code> is pretty simple:
<code>nc ipaddress portnum</code><br />
<br />
If you were connecting to IP 1.2.3.4 at port 9876, it would be:<br />
<code> nc 1.2.3.4 9876</code><br />
<br />
Try that first! - substituting the IP and port that you are connecting to.<br />
<br />
If you tried it, you might be saying "Well, now what?". This is all I got:<br />
<pre>
â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliã‰¿kali)-[~]
â””â”€$ nc 10.0.0.19 21141

</pre>
<br />
See all that nothingness after the nc command where I should be getting somethingness?!<br />
<br />
Remember that Crunkbunny said:<br />
<code>If you use netcat to send a certain favorite word of mine ("kaboom" of course) to a certain port (21141) on this machine...</code><br />
<br />
So how do you send a word using <code>netcat</code>? The simplest way would be to connect, as you did above, type in the word, and hit Enter!

<p>Netkitty1, the first netkitty ever (whatever that means) needs your help! This time, sheâ€™s automated the netcat process, but needs you to fill in a couple gaps. Letâ€™s see how!</p>

<span style="color:DodgerBlue">
You have some steps to perform here:<br />
<ul>
<li>Decode the username</li>
<ul>
<li><code>hURL -b YmFzdGV0</code></li>
<li> ... or use <a href="https://cyberchef.org">CyberChef</a> or a similar online resource</li>
<li> to get the username: bastet</li>
</ul>
<li>Download the Python script</li>
<ul>
<li><code>wget targetip:65534/hack_the_cat.py</code></li>
</ul>
<li>Edit the Python script</li>
<ul>
<li>Now that it's on your local machine, you can edit the script using any number of text editing apps.</li>
<li>I'd recommend something that does syntax highlighting (color codes the program's syntax to make it easier to edit stuff). If you want to be able to do it graphically (so you can use your mouse to edit), I'd recommend VS Code or its open-source alternative code-oss. You don't need all its features for our usage here, but it might be good to be familiar with the app nonetheless.</li>
<li>Try running <code>code-oss</code> from within Kali to see if you have it installed.<br />
<br />
If not, you'll need to 
</li>

</ul>
<li>Run the Python script</li>
<ul>
<li>
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;q
