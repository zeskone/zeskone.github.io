Kind of similar to FTP, SSH to a server with:
<code>ssh x.x.x.x -l username</code><br />
or<br />
<code>ssh username@x.x.x.x</code><br />
... where x.x.x.x is the IP address of the SSH server.<br />
<br />
<blockquote>The first time you SSH to something, you'll get a warning about the authenticity of the host and fingerprint, and blah, blah, blah. Just type yes at the warning message. What could possibly go wrong with that?</blockquote><br />
Enter the password when prompted.<br />

To list files, use <code>ls</code>.<br /><br />
To output the contents a file to your screen, type:<br />
<code>cat filename</code><br /><br />

Use:<br />

You can tell if they are hidden because they have a . in front of the directory or file name. It's like a really little kid playing hide and seek ... "If I put a dot in front of my name, you can't see me, right?!"

After reading crashoverride's message, take a look at the <code>find</code> help.
<br />
Disclaimer - I personally find the CLI help for <code>find</code> to be ... not so helpful. If you don't find the help you need in <code>find</code>'s help, maybe you'll find that the help you find online will help you use <code>find</code> in a way that helps. Something like that.<br />
<br />
Suggested search: <b>linux find examples</b><br />
<br />
You can also check the manual for <code>find</code> - it's really long, but much more clear to me than the <code>--help</code> information. While we're at it - I might as well mention that you can also find the manual for most commands online really easily too! I like doing that because you can easily use CTRL+f to search on the page for a specific word if you'd like. How do you find the manuals? I typically just use the same words I'd use at the CLI! In this case, just do a search for "man find". This one in particular may come up with unrelated results, but you should also find the manual info too!

Use:<br />
<code>find . -name thep*</code><br />
Let's break that down:

<li><code>.</code> - the humble period is Linux's shorthand for "this directory". This tells find to look here. Find works recursively by default, so you don't have to tell it to do that like you would with <code>ls</code></li>
<li><code>-name</code> - this tells find that the attribute of the file we're searching by is the name. Of course it's the file name! What else would you search by?! You may be sorry you asked in a bit :)</li>
<li><code>thep*</code> - "thep" is the only piece of the filename that user crashoverride gave us. You have to put the wildcard * after that since you don't know if or how many characters follow that part of the file name.</li>

Using the search term: "first story with Bilbo and Gollum" in a Google search gets you a lot of answers related to the 1937 book, "The Hobbit".
Using that search term in Bing (as of September 2022 anyway) gets you a nice clear-cut answer:
<image src="/images/hobbit.png"></image><br />
<br />
So now you just have to find the file made in 1937! Wow, this computer must be old, huh?
For that, we revisit our old friend <code>ls</code>. The <code>-l</code> option outputs the directory's contents in what they call "list" format, which includes some more info besides just the file names, for example, the last time the file was modified!<br />
<br />
<pre>
gollum@thehaxthatrocksthecradle:~/.treasures$ ls -l
total 280
... [snipped output] ...
-rw-rw-r-- 1 gollum gollum 23 Jul 29  1937 a1d0c6e83f027327d8461063f4ac58a6
</pre>
Now, it's just a matter of copying that file name, and pasting it into a cat command to output its contents!<br />

<summary>Level 16 - Full Answer</summary>

<br />
<span style="color:MediumSeaGreen">
Running the <code>uniq</code> command by itself isn't quite enough.<br />
By default, it will just de-duplicate the lines in the file. That still leaves us with a lot (12,595) lines, and doesn't tell us which one was unique to begin with!<br />
Using the <code>-u</code> option shows us <bold>only</bold> the unique line, and ignores the rest:
<pre>
bilbo@thehaxthatrocksthecradle:~$ uniq -u creds 
99b2a15856249b868abbfc92dea6cee6
</pre>
<br />
Note that this won't work in a file with randomized lines, you'd have to sort the lines first. <code>uniq</code> compares one
