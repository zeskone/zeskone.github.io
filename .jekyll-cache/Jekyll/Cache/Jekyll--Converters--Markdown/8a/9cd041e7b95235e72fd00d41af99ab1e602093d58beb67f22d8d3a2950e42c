I",<p>We’re going to shift focus now and look at some encoding and decoding of data, with a couple hash-related things thrown in.</p>

<p>First, maybe some quick explanations are in order if you haven’t run across these terms before. These are intended to be super high level. Entire books can be written about each of these topics!</p>

<h1 id="encoding-and-decoding">Encoding and Decoding</h1>
<p>Encoding data transforms it into another form. The reasons for doing so can vary, but the important part for you to know is that if you know how data is encoded, it is easily decoded. No further information is needed.
Typically, if you take a small piece of data (like one word, for example) and encode it, the result is also very small. Likewise, if you take a super long piece of data (like a book), the result will be similarly long.</p>

<h1 id="hashing">Hashing</h1>
<p>Hashing also transforms data, but a key difference is that it cannot be reversed … well, not directly anyway. Even if you know the algorithm used, you can’t really take a hash and figure out what the data was originally. What you CAN do hash a piece of data, see if it matches your hash, and if it doesn’t, try another piece of data and so on. Sound like a lot of effort? It can be, but for computers, it can go very quickly, depending on the algorithm used.
How about hash length? It’s always consistent! A hash created using the MD5 algorithm will be 32 characters. 
Hash a single letter? 32 characters. 
Hash a 10 GB file? 32 characters.</p>

<h1 id="encryption-and-decryption">Encryption and Decryption</h1>
<p>Like encoding, encryption also transforms data into another form.
Like encoding, the length of the output also depends on the length of the input.
So what’s the difference? One major difference for users is that even if you know the algorithm used, you still need a <em>key</em> to decrypt the data.</p>

The steps you'll need to complete this level are:
<ul>
<li>Show owners for directories in /</li>
<li>Find out how to make a directory in Linux and make one</li>
<li>Make a hidden directory</li>
<li>Make an empty file</li>
<li>Make a hidden empty file</li>
<li>Check the URL given</li>

The steps fully detailed out are:
<ul>
<li>Show owners for directories in /</li>
<ul>
<li>Use <code>ls</code> and the <code>-l</code> option along with specifically telling the command to look in <code>/</code> instead of your current directory (its default behavior).</li>
<li><pre>

</pre></li>
</ul>
<li>Find out how to make a directory in Linux</li>
<ul>
<li><pre>mkdir free_dinner</pre></li>
<li>If you get no messages in return, it means your command worked - one of those quiet victories, I suppose.</li>
<li>Now you have to wait (no command needed for that, just uhh, take your hands off the keyboard for a minute?) , check the contents directory of the directory you made, and then output the contents of the new file in that directory. Since you're a pro at those things already, I'll leave the steps out.</li>
</ul>
<li>Make a hidden directory in Linux</li>
<ul>
<li>Same command as last time, but you just have to know that a hidden directory or file has a <code>.</code> in front of the file name.</li>
<li><code>mkdir .forest_tea</code></li>
<li>Wait, check directory contents, check file</li>
</ul>
<li>Make an empty file</li>
<ul>
<li><code>touch</code> is used to update the Last Modified Date of a file. If the file doesn't exist though, it makes an empty file with the name you supplied!</li>
<li><code>touch oven</code></li>
<li>Wait, check file contents</li>
</ul>
<li>Make a hidden empty file</li>
<ul>
<li><code>touch</code> is our go-to command again, just use a <code>.</code> to make the file hidden!</li>
<li><code>touch .dwarf_net</code></li>
</ul>
<li>Check the URL given</li>
<ul>
<li>Again, use <code>wget</code>:</li>
<li><code>wget targeturl</code></li>
<li>If you can't view the image on your attacking machine in your environment, replace the http://targetip:8000/images/ in the URL with https://zeskone.github.io/images/ and view it on a device that has web access.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
