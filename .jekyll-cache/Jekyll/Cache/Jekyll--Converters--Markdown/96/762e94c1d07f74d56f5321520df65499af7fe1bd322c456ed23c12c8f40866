Check out usage information for <code>netcat</code>. This is another utility where, honestly, the <code>--help</code> leaves me ... not helped. Maybe check the <code>man</code> for it or find some help online.

It may be worth pointing out that people very often us <code>nc</code> as the command for <code>netcat</code>. So often in fact, that I <i>just</i> found out right now that you can use the full word <code>netcat</code> - at least in current versions of Kali and Ubuntu. Who knew? (not me, apparently).<br />
<br />
Once you know the command to use, the syntax for <code>nc</code> is pretty simple:
<code>nc ipaddress portnum</code><br />
<br />
If you were connecting to IP 1.2.3.4 at port 9876, it would be:<br />
<code> nc 1.2.3.4 9876</code><br />
<br />
Try that first!<br />
<br />
If you tried it, you might be saying "Well, now what?". This is all I got:<br />
<pre>
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ nc 10.0.0.19 21141

</pre>
<br />
See all that nothingness after the nc command where I should be getting somethingness?!<br />
Remember that Crunkbunny said:<br />
<code>If you use netcat to send a certain favorite word of mine ("kaboom" of course) to a certain port (21141) on this machine...</code><br />
<br />
So how do you send a word using <code>netcat</code>? The simplest way would be to connect, as you did above, type in the word and hit Enter!
