<span style="color:MediumSeaGreen">
Linux doesn't let you run/execute a program unless the file specifically has the permissions set up to do so. Check the permissions with <code>ls -la</code>:
<pre>
sekhmet@thehaxthatrocksthecradle:~$ ls -la runthisthing 
-rw-rw-r-- 1 sekhmet sekhmet 16744 Apr  2  2021 runthisthing
</pre>
<br />
The file permissions are all those letters/symbols at the beginning of the second line, to the left of the number 1. But how do you read all that mess? To fully understand it would require a long explanation, so let's just go with the basics for now and explain it all with some handy color-coding.<br />
<br />
<code>
<span style="color:purple">-</span>
<span style="color:DarkOrange">rw-</span>
<span style="color:DarkSlateBlue">rw-</span>
<span style="color:DeepPink">r--</span>
 1 
 <span style="color:DarkOrange">sekhmet </span>
<span style="color:DarkSlateBlue"> sekhmet </span>
 16744 Apr  2  2021 runthisthing</code><br />
<br />
<span style="color:purple"><code>-</code> - This will typically just be a <code>-</code> if it's a file or a letter <code>d</code> if it's a directory. Ours is a file, we don't need anything else from it here.</span><br />
<span style="color:DarkOrange"><code>rw-</code> - This indicates that the owner of the file can read it and write to it. A letter means the permission is present, a dash means that permission is not present. The owner in this case is our buddy Sekhmet (the first <code>sekhmet</code> is the owner)</span> <br />
<span style="color:DarkSlateBlue"><code>rw-</code> - Same thing here, but this is for the owning group. The second <code>sekhmet</code> is the owning group. We can see that the sekhmet group can also read and write to the file</span><br />
<span style="color:DeepPink"><code>r--</code> - These are the permissions for everyone else. Everyone can read the file, but they can't write to it.</span><br />
<br />
So now what? Well, we want to add <b>execution</b> permissions to the file, which would be represented by an <code>x</code> instead of the <code>-</code> in the third column for each permission set. The easiest way to do that would be:<br />
<code>chmod +x runthisthing</code><br />
<br />
This adds the <code>x</code> to all the permissions for this file. Note that this means everyone can execute this file now! You can get more granular, but we're just going for quick and easy right now.<br />
Check the permissions after running that and they should be:<br />
&lt;code


There's a lot more to permissions that I didn't cover - you can certainly find more info online, such as here: <a href="https://linuxhandbook.com/linux-file-permissions/">https://linuxhandbook.com/linux-file-permissions/</a>
