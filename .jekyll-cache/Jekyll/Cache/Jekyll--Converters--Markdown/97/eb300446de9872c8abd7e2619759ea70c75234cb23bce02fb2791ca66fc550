I"ó<p>Welcome to The Hax that Rocks the Cradle!</p>

<h1 id="what-is-this-anyway">What Is This Anyway?</h1>
<p>The purpose of this intentionally vulnerable VM is to help you get used to some security related concepts while learning Linux stuff along the way.</p>

<p>The first few challenges are web related. Nothing in depth, but you‚Äôll need to be able to browse to the victim host and use both your browser and a tool or two to enumerate the site.</p>

<p>After those initial web related stages, we‚Äôll delve into the Linux CLI (command line interface) for the rest of your time here! It can be intimidating at first, leaving the comfort of a graphical environment. Hopefully by the time you‚Äôre done, you will have used a lot of basic CLI commands so much that it won‚Äôt be nearly so intimidating.</p>

<h1 id="who-is-this-for">Who is This For?</h1>
<p>The target audience is anyone who is interested in learning a bit more about security and about Linux (specifically the CLI).
The guide will assume you know how to use a computer, look stuff up online, and open a terminal window, and ‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs mostly it. There will be clues inside the VM itself, and you‚Äôll be filled in on more here if you need it.</p>

<h1 id="what-do-you-need">What Do You Need?</h1>
<p>An ‚Äúattacking machine‚Äù that is preferably Linux, preferably Kali or Parrot. While not strictly required, this will make using (and possibly installing) the needed tools easier.</p>

<p>New to VMs? Check this out:</p>

<p>If <strong>not</strong> using Kali or Parrot, you‚Äôll need to able to use or install:</p>
<ul>
  <li>nmap</li>
  <li>Web directory brute forcer</li>
  <li>SSH client</li>
  <li>base64 decoder (or use one online)</li>
  <li>Code editor with Python support (or just a text editor if you want to go old school)</li>
  <li>SSH brute forcer</li>
  <li>cewl - or another tool that makes a wordlist based on site contents</li>
  <li>hashcat - or another password cracking tool and one that can mangle wordlists</li>
</ul>

<p>Kind of a lot of things, right? If that list seems daunting ‚Ä¶ just use Kali or Parrot, one step at a time!</p>
