<span style="color:MediumSeaGreen">
Linux doesn't let you run/execute a program unless the file specifically has the permissions set up to do so. Check the permissions with <code>ls -la</code>:
<pre>
sekhmet@thehaxthatrocksthecradle:~$ ls -la runthisthing 
-rw-rw-r-- 1 sekhmet sekhmet 16744 Apr  2  2021 runthisthing
</pre>
<br />
The file permissions are all those letters/symbols at the beginning of the second line, to the left of the number 1. But how do you read all that mess? To fully understand it would require a long explanation, so let's just go with the basics for now and explain it all with some handy color-coding.<br />
<br />
<code>
<span style="color:purple">-</span>
<span style="color:DarkOrange">rw-</span>
<span style="color:DarkSlateBlue">rw-</span>
<span style="color:DeepPink">r--</span>
 1 
 <span style="color:DarkOrange">sekhmet </span>
<span style="color:DarkSlateBlue"> sekhmet </span>
 16744 Apr  2  2021 runthisthing</code><br />
<br />
<span style="color:purple"><code>-</code> - This will typically just be a <code>-</code> if it's a file or a letter <code>d</code> if it's a directory. Ours is a file, we don't need anything else from it here.</span><br />
<span style="color:DarkOrange"><code>rw-</code> - This indicates that the owner of the file can read it and write to it. A letter means the permission is present, a dash means that permission is not present. The owner in this case is our buddy Sekhmet (the first sekhmet is the owner)</span> 
<span style="color:DarkSlateBlue"><code>rw-</code> - Same thing here, but this is for the owning group. The second sek</span>
<span style="color:DeepPink"><code>r--</code></span>
