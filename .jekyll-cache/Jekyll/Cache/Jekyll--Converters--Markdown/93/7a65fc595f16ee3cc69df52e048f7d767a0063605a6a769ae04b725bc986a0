<p>We’re going to shift focus now and look at some encoding and decoding of data, with a couple hash-related things thrown in.</p>

<p>First, maybe some quick explanations are in order if you haven’t run across these terms before. These are intended to be super high level. Entire books can be written about each of these topics!</p>

<h1 id="encoding-and-decoding">Encoding and Decoding</h1>
<p>Encoding data transforms it into another form. The reasons for doing so can vary, but the important part for you to know is that if you know how data is encoded, it is easily decoded. No further information is needed.
Typically, if you take a small piece of data (like one word, for example) and encode it, the result is also very small. Likewise, if you take a super long piece of data (like a book), the result will be similarly long.</p>

<h1 id="hashing">Hashing</h1>
<p>Hashing also transforms data, but a key difference is that it cannot be reversed … well, not directly anyway. Even if you know the algorithm used, you can’t really take a hash and figure out what the data was originally. What you CAN do hash a piece of data, see if it matches your hash, and if it doesn’t, try another piece of data and so on. Sound like a lot of effort? It can be, but for computers, it can go very quickly, depending on the algorithm used.
How about hash length? It’s always consistent! A hash created using the MD5 algorithm will be 32 characters. 
Hash a single letter? 32 characters. 
Hash a 10 GB file? 32 characters.</p>

<h1 id="encryption-and-decryption">Encryption and Decryption</h1>
<p>Like encoding, encryption also transforms data into another form.
Like encoding, the length of the output also depends on the length of the input.
So what’s the difference? One major difference for users is that even if you know the algorithm used, you still need a <em>key</em> to decrypt the data.</p>

<p>Let’s help Gimli out with this decoding task, the poor guy. He does the best he can.</p>

Remember that Gimli mentioned a few things:
bai'nairee to ah'skee (sound it out and look it up if they seem familiar!)

This one would be tricky if you haven't heard these terms before - I blame the dwarf:<br />
bai'nairee = binary<br />
ah'skee = ASCII = American Standard Code for Information Interchange<br />
