Check out usage information for <code>netcat</code>. This is another utility where, honestly, the <code>--help</code> leaves me ... not helped. Maybe check the <code>man</code> for it or find some help online.

It may be worth pointing out that people very often us <code>nc</code> as the command for <code>netcat</code>. So often in fact, that I <i>just</i> found out right now that you can use the full word <code>netcat</code> - at least in current versions of Kali and Ubuntu. Who knew? (not me, apparently).<br />
<br />
Once you know the command to use, the syntax for <code>nc</code> is pretty simple:
<code>nc 1.2.3.4 9876

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
