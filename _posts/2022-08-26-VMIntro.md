# Virtual Machines (VMs):

The usage of VMs is prevalent in the tech world in general, and security is no exception. We frequently use VMs for penetration testing related operating systems, like Kali or Parrot.

You need two things to get a VM up and running:

## 1 - VM Software

VMWare - [https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player.html](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player.html)

VMWare has a paid version and a free “Workstation Player” version. Follow the link above, scroll to the downloads link at the bottom to download the installation file.

VirtualBox - [https://www.virtualbox.org](https://www.virtualbox.org)

A free virtual machine solution - it will still have everything you need to get started with installing and using VMs.


## 2 - An actual operating system

These two Linux distributions are heavily security-focused and come with a large number of security related tools pre-installed, and many more available in their repositories.

Just make sure to pay attention to whether you’re downloading the VMWare or VirtualBox version of their VM:

Kali - [https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines)

Parrot - [https://www.parrotsec.org](https://www.parrotsec.org)

*Note that as of August 2022, Parrot requires a manual installation of the OS. If you’re just getting into this for the first time, consider using Kali’s pre-packaged virtual machines, as it will take some of the labor and possible confusion out of the OS setup.*


You can install any operating system’s .iso file as a VM - such as Ubuntu, Fedora, Windows (Microsoft offers free VMs for Windows), etc. This makes it possible to experiment with different operating systems quickly/easily.
