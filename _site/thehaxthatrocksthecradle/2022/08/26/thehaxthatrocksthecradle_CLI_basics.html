<p>You got another set of credentials - and not for the last time!</p>

<p>Use that to connect to the target host via SSH.</p>

<p>Once you’ve done that, see what files are available to you and see what you can find in the file(s).</p>

<span style="color:DodgerBlue">
To the Internet for help once more! I don't suggest this all the time because I'm lazy (that's a possible contributing factor though!), but because this is probably the most valuable skill you can develop - learning how to find more information!

<li>SSH usage</li>
<li>show files in Linux</li>

Kind of similar to FTP, SSH to a server with:
<code>ssh x.x.x.x -l username</code><br />
or<br />
<code>ssh username@x.x.x.x</code><br />
... where x.x.x.x is the IP address of the SSH server.<br />
<br />
<blockquote>The first time you SSH to something, you'll get a warning about the authenticity of the host and fingerprint, and blah, blah, blah. Just type yes at the warning message. What could possibly go wrong with that?</blockquote><br />
Enter the password when prompted.<br />
<br />
To list files, use <code>ls</code>.<br /><br />
To output the contents a file to your screen, type:<br />
<code>cat filename</code><br /><br />
To disconnect from this session, type <code>exit</code>.<br />

<br />
<span style="color:DodgerBlue">
<code>ls</code> is a command, and has a help file! Remember how to check that from the CLI? Note that for some commands, some of these options might not work, depending on ... a lot of things:<br />
<ul>
<li><code>commandname -h</code></li>
<li><code>commandname --help</code></li>
<li><code>man commandname</code></li>
</ul>

<span style="color:MediumSeaGreen">
Use:<br />
<code>ls -a</code><br />
... to show <b>all</b> directories and files in your current directory, even if they're "hidden".<br />
<br />
You can tell if they are hidden because they have a . in front of the directory or file name. It's like a really little kid playing hide and seek ... "If I put a dot in front of my name, you can't see me, right?!"

<span style="color:MediumSeaGreen">
Use:<br />

<span style="color:DodgerBlue">
After reading crashoverride's message, take a look at the <code>find</code> help.
<br />
Disclaimer - I personally find the CLI help for <code>find</code> to be ... not so helpful. If you don't find the help you need in <code>find</code>'s help, maybe you'll find that the help you find online will help you use <code>find</code> in a way that helps. Something like that.<br />
<br />
Suggested search: <b>linux find examples</b><br />
<br />
You can also check the manual for <code>find</code> - it's really long, but much more clear to me than the <code>--help</code> information. While we're at it - I might as well mention that you can also find the manual for most commands online really easily too! I like doing that because you can easily use CTRL+f to search on the page for a specific word if you'd like. How do you find the manuals? I typically just use the same words I'd use at the CLI! In this case, just do a search for "man find". This one in particular may come up with unrelated results, but you should also find the manual info too!

<span style="color:MediumSeaGreen">
Use:<br />
<code>find . -name thep*</code><br />
Let's break that down:
<ul>
<li><code>.</code> - the humble period is Linux's shorthand for "this directory". This tells find to look here. Find works recursively by default, so you don't have to tell it to do that like you would with <code>ls</code></li>
<li><code>-name</code> - this tells find that the attribute of the file we're searching by is the name. Of course it's the file name! What else would you search by?! You may be sorry you asked in a bit :)</li>
<li><code>thep*</code> - "thep" is the only piece of the filename that user crashoverride gave us. You have to put the wildcard * after that since you don't know if or how many characters follow that part of the file name.</li>
</ul>

Again, check the <code>find</code> help or online examples.

<code>find</code> is case sensitive by default - tell it to be the opposite.

Use:<br />
<code>find . -iname razor*</code><br />
Let's break that down:
<ul>
<li><code>.</code> - the humble period is Linux's shorthand for "this directory". This tells find to look here. Find works recursively by default, so you don't have to tell it to do that like you would with <code>ls</code></li>
<li><code>-iname</code> - like last time, this tells find that the attribute of the file we're searching by is the name, but the <b>i</b> in <code>iname</code> means to search in a <b>case insensitive</b> manner.</li>
<li><code>razor*</code> - "razor" is the only piece of the filename that user theplague gave us. You have to put the wildcard * after that since you don't know if or how many characters follow that part of the file name.</li>

<span style="color:DodgerBlue">
After checking razor's helpful file* check the <code>find</code> help or online examples.

* - don't see a file from razor? Remember all the <code>ls</code> options?<br />

Now. Now is when you do that!

<li><code>.</code> - the humble period is Linux's shorthand for "this directory". This tells find to look here. Find works recursively by default, so you don't have to tell it to do that like you would with <code>ls</code></li>

<br />
Now that you have that super long file path, <code>cat</code> it out to see the contents.
Remember (or maybe you're learning this for the first time!) that to copy and paste from the Linux CLI, the keyboard shortcuts are:<br />
<code>CTRL+SHIFT+c</code> - copy<br />
<code>CTRL+SHIFT+v</code> - paste<br />
