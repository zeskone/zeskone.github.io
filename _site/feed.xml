<h1 id="what-is-this-anyway">What Is This Anyway?</h1>
<p>The purpose of this intentionally vulnerable VM is to help you get used to some security related concepts while learning Linux stuff along the way.</p>

<p>The first few challenges are web related. Nothing in depth, but you’ll need to be able to browse to the victim host and use both your browser and a tool or two to enumerate the site.</p>

<p>After those initial web related stages, we’ll delve into the Linux CLI (command line interface) for the rest of your time here! It can be intimidating at first, leaving the comfort of a graphical environment. Hopefully by the time you’re done, you will have used a lot of basic CLI commands so much that it won’t be nearly so intimidating.</p>

<h1 id="who-is-this-for">Who is This For?</h1>
<p>The target audience is anyone who is interested in learning a bit more about security and about Linux (specifically the CLI).
The guide will assume you know how to use a computer, look stuff up online, and open a terminal window, and … that’s mostly it. There will be clues inside the VM itself, and you’ll be filled in on more here if you need it.</p>

<h1 id="what-do-you-need">What Do You Need?</h1>
<p>An “attacking machine” that is preferably Linux, preferably Kali or Parrot. While not strictly required, this will make using (and possibly installing) the needed tools easier.
If not using Kali or Parrot, you’ll need to able to use or install:</p>
<ul>
  <li>nmap</li>
  <li>Web directory brute forcer</li>
  <li>SSH client</li>
  <li>base64 decoder (or use one online)</li>
  <li>Code editor with Python support (or just a text editor if you want to go old school)</li>
  <li>SSH brute forcer</li>
  <li>cewl - or another tool that makes a wordlist based on site contents</li>
  <li>hashcat - or another password cracking tool and one that can mangle wordlists</li>
</ul>

Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve</code>, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.</p>

<p>Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP</code></p>

<p>Where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR</code> is a four-digit number, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MONTH</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DAY</code> are both two-digit numbers, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MARKUP</code> is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.</p>

<p>Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Hi, </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
<span class="n">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'Tom'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1">#=&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.</span></code></pre></figure>
